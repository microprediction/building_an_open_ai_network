Questions from MIT Press

### Elevator pitch

What if there was a source of intelligence, akin to a electrical outlet, which was easy for anyone to plug into? The book is a
call to action to create a utility as transformative as the web itself, one providing AI to everyone at arbitrarily low cost. 


### Key Points

* Prognostications on the future of artificial intelligence have long taken on the flavor of science fiction. But long before any of those far flung visions are realized, a profound reconstruction of industry will occur.

* There is a profound contradiction in the artisan production of machine learning.   

* In a future state, companies and individuals cleave the open-ended search for models and data away from other business logic. 

* In doing so they will encourage commoditization of microprediction, and super-exponential growth in a new and revolutionary construct: a fabric on which algorithms, data, entangled secrets and other strange denezins of a strange new micro-world collectively solve search in the space of models and data. 

* The book advances this thesis through the through the lenses of economics, statistics, privacy preserving computation, amd
control theory. 

* It is argued that the current high cost of bespoke quantitative business optimization, and the unlevel playing field this creates, is little more than a  modern day tragedy of the commons whose solution is mere busywork requiring no new theoretical advances.  

* A prediction web will address only "half" of statistics, but do so very well, for everyone.
