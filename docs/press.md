### Elevator pitch

What if there was a source of intelligence, akin to a electrical outlet, which was easy for anyone to plug into? The book is a
call to action to create a utility as transformative as the web itself, one providing authonomous intelligence to everyone that is eventually hard to beat.


### Key Points

Prognostications on the future of artificial intelligence have long taken on the flavor of science fiction. But long before any of those far flung visions are realized, 
a more mundane reconstruction of industry will occur, one where companies cleave the open-ended search for models and data away from other business logic. In doing
so they will encourage super-exponential growth in a new and revolutionary construct: a fabric on which algorithms, data, entangled secrets and other strange denezins of a strange
new micro-world will travel. In *Microprediction*, the author considers this possibility through the lenses of economics, statistics, privacy preserving computation, amd
control theory. The author argues that the current high cost of bespoke quantitative business optimization, and the unlevel playing field this creates, is a modern day
tragedy of the commons whose solution is, at some level, mere busywork. Cost can be radically
curtailed by collective microprediction and the encouragement of largely autonomous, ruthlessly competitive, miniature supply chains. This can address
only "half" of statistics, but can do so very well, and for everyone.
