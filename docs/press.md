Questions from MIT Press

### Elevator pitch

What if there was a source of intelligence, akin to a electrical outlet, which was easy for anyone to plug into? The book is a
call to action to create a utility as transformative as the web itself, one providing AI to everyone at arbitrarily low cost. 


### Key Points

* Prognostications on the future of artificial intelligence have long taken on the flavor of science fiction. But long before any of those far flung visions are realized, a profound reconstruction of the way industry uses analytics will occur.   

* As companies recognize the contradiction inherent in the artisan production of machine learning, they will cleave the open-ended search for models and data away from other business logic. 

* In doing so they will encourage commoditization of microprediction and the super-exponential growth in a new and revolutionary construct: a fabric on which algorithms, data, entangled secrets and other strange denezins of a new micro-world provide a networked solution.

* The provision of useful operational intelligence, which is ultimately search in the space of models and data, will resemble the solution to document search, and prerequisite construction of backlinks, more than it resembles the creation of a new chemical in a lab, say, or a singular discovery by a machine learning expert or team.    

* The book advances this thesis through the through the lenses of statistics, privacy preserving computation, control theory, and most importantly economics. Competing paradigms go up against the local knowledge problem.  

* The current high cost of bespoke quantitative business optimization, and the unlevel playing field this creates, is in part a modern day tragedy of the commons whose solution is mere busywork, requiring no new theoretical advances.  

* A prediction web will address only "half" of statistics, but do so very well, for everyone.  


### Audience profile

Managers, quants, data scientists, machine learning practitioners, analytics consumers of various kinds, and keen observations of the role of analytics in industries such as finance, internet of things, manufacturing, logistics and others requiring real-time operational intelligence and optimization.
