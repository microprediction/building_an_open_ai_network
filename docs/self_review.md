Will data science will be Hayak'd by nano-noodling nimphs?

Will these primitive players be provoked by proper penalties into participating in percipient, probabilistic prophesy - one where their privacy-preserving product permeates Pigovian and property precautious, and promotes public-private positive profit propensity? Will a phasmagorical parimutuel party in the periphery progress percentile prediction to peak potency? 

This is preposterous, and yet once a population of Python-powered predators provides production power parity
and pricks probabilistic pomposity, this could be potentially problematic, even painful, for a plutocracy of platonic
imposters preciding over precious protected pyramids of pricy Ph.D.s.  

The scenarios is marginally more likely than someone finding a use for blockchain or factoring 42 on a quantum computer, though it is also
possible that the book sells about as many copies as there are contributors to the project, leading to a collapse
in the secondary market and a forecasting regime change that would leave the most nimble microprediction 
supply chain in disarray. 

Either way, the ratio of accuracy to cost of this book will eventually be hard to beat.
