Will data science will be Hayak'd by nano-noodling nimphs 
provoked by primitive penalties participating in percipient, probabilistic prophesy, one where their product
permeates privacy, Pigovian and property precautious, and promotes public-private positive profit propensity? Will a phasmagorical
parimutuel party in the periphery progress percentile prediction to peak potency? 

This is preposterous, and yet potentially problematic, even painful, for a plutocracy of platonic
imposters preciding over their precious protectionist pyramids of pricy people, once a population 
of Python-powered predators achieves production power parity and pricks probabilistic pomposity. 

It is more likely than someone finding a use for blockchain or factoring 42 on a quantum computer, though it is also
possible that the book sells about as many copies as there are contributors to the project, leading to a collapse
in the secondary market and a forecasting regime change that would leave the most nimble microprediction 
supply chain in disarray. 

Either way, the ratio of accuracy to cost of this book will eventually be hard to beat.
