Will data science will be Hayak'd by nano-noodling nimphs 
provoked by the pursuit of primitive penalties into participating in percipient, probabilistic prophesy, one where their product
permeates privacy and property precautious, and promotes public-private positive profit propensity? Will a phasmagorical
parimutuel party in the periphery progress percentile prediction to peak potency? 

This is preposterous, and yet potentially problematic, even painful, for a plutocracy of platonic
imposters preciding over their precious protectionist pyramids of pricy people, once a population 
of Python-powered predators achieves production power parity - a partial Pigou phenominom pricking 
probabilistic pomposity.

Well, I suppose it is more likely than someone finding a use for blockchain or factoring 42 on a quantum computer. 
Though I fear the book might sell about as many copies as there are contributors to the project, leading to a collapse
in the secondary market and a forecasting regime change that would leave even the most nimble prediction supply chain in disarray. 

Either way, this book will eventually be hard to beat as judged by the ratio of accuracy to cost.
