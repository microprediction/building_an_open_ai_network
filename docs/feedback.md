Rachid Lassoued, Global Head of Financial Engineering & Risk, Bloomberg

>> Great initiative and quite innovative framework developed in your platform (and your great book which is certainly one of the most interesting read I had in 2022)

Oledkssy Lialka, Data Scientist, Kiarna

>> Microprediction by Peter Cotton is a smart read. The author lays down the foundations of greenfield mass prediction as a service with an economic rationale and a high-level system design vision. The evolution alike we've already seen with the cloud infrastructure. The read is dense and packed with statistics, economics, and optimal control, all intertwined into a cohesive and engaging story. Remember to throw it into your weekender bag. Trust me, you will enjoy it.

>>Cotton is a brilliant, original, 'out of the box' thinker with command of his subject. Cotton's Microprediction is necessary reading for those whose success depends upon data-driven predictions.”

Matthew Kolakowski, Data Scientist

>> If you want to read a book that will open your mind to new horizons on prediction, buy this one now. Peter takes a fantastic approach and examines the possibilities of microprediction. Great book and a must have on your data science reading list.

Allesandro Chiruzzi, Lead Data Scientist

>> Peter Cotton might not be 'the man who solved the market', but his book sure has a lot of insights and a vision on how to solve many data-related problems companies (of any size) will be facing in the very next future. Microprediction might have a serious and corporate looking front cover, but don't let that fool you. Inside you'll find a witty and engaging read, rarely seen in books dealing with such topics.

Azat Aslanov, PhD 
Senior Data and Systems Analyst, QBE Insuranc

>> As for a quant that runs aground on the technical clumsiness of the underlying data pipelines world of today, the brilliant exploration of fascinating novel ideas is a breath of fresh air: from statistical crowd-sourcing to interplay between software-engineered oracles and reinforcement learning to temporal difference.

Mark Trinquero. AWS Solutions Architect.

>> Excellent read (note: You may not agree with every point made) Peter’s deep knowledge of AI/ML/DS domains, combined with expertise in crowdsourcing & belief in the fundamental power of markets provide a very solid argument for building open AI networks that can serve as public utility (creating novel approaches that can even outperform “SOTA” models)

>> Highly recommend Peter Cotton's recent book on microprediction! Great read, can't agree more, and looking forward to the microprediction network becoming more entrenched in reality.
