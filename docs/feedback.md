# Praise and criticism for the [book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262047326/microprediction/)


>>Cotton is a brilliant, original, 'out of the box' thinker with command of his subject. Cotton's Microprediction is necessary reading for those whose success depends upon data-driven predictions.”

>>Microprediction aims to disrupt what Cotton has coined the 'artisan data science' economy and to bring the cost of all prediction to zero.

>>Peter Cotton surveys the advantages, costs, and pitfalls involved in the real-time crowdsourcing of data and artificial intelligence. Readers will explore the frontier of this increasingly popular and valuable modeling approach, catching a glimpse of where it might someday lead.

>> The great playwright and short-story writer Anton Chekhov had hoped for his "brevity is the soul of wit" to be put to good use. The dictum is even more applicable to a mathematically inclined subject such as machine learning, and although the laconic strength of mathematical symbolism would have allowed for an easier task, the author has written the book on AI mostly in the compressed vernacular - to "influence the perception of quantitative work and its future" for a much wider audience. As for a quant that runs aground on the technical clumsiness of the underlying data pipelines world of today, the brilliant exploration of fascinating novel ideas is a breath of fresh air: from statistical crowd-sourcing to interplay between software-engineered oracles and reinforcement learning to temporal difference.

>> Yes, I like to think of the book more as a play where its main characters "hungry micromanagers" increasingly populate the web of predictions on nano levels....and as an infinite number of infinitesimals can be summed up to calculate an integral, the author argues for clever utilisation of prediction efforts governed through micromanagement (pun intended but no spoilers here!) to build an open-source prediction web where one of the outcomes is bespoke AI on tap. Howzat?! My initial impression was that of new metamathematics for machine learning algorithms - structure-wise somewhat akin to G\''odel numberings.

>> Moreover, the author generously brings a reader to the "greenfield" of opportunities to actively get involved in the cutting edge AI as deep as one can get to, where the usual suspects are paper, pencil and Python.
